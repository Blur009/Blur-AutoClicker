### Why I made this

I started this mainly because I wanted to just make a program, but after some time I 
realized that popular alternatives struggle to actually deliver what I wanted. The clicks 
per second that some were promising (mostly when the cps gets very high) were far off 
their actual speed. Some of them were also lacking features I wanted (like Duty Cycle or 
Randomization).

### Future Updates

I'd like to include updates from within the app and of course saving the settings when the app is closed😅

### Info

This is my first real project (other than my website) so it might not be perfect, report bugs in this git repo. Thank you. 
Since I am new to Python and VERY new in C, this is made with a lot of help from GLM-4.7 (AI).
